# LoanPredictionProject_Backend
This repository contains the source code for a full-stack web development project that integrates machine learning capabilities, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, for loan prediction. The project utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for web development, focusing on loan financing.
